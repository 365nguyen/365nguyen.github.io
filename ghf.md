## 1. What are Enterprise Managed Users?

**It's a GitHub Enterprise feature that allows you to manage user access from an external identity provider such as Azure AD or Okta.**

### Explanation:
Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) is a feature in **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** that allows enterprises to control and manage user identities and access via external identity providers, such as **Azure AD** or **Okta**. With this feature, all user accounts in the organization are managed directly by the identity provider, enabling enterprises to enforce security policies, such as single sign-on (SSO), and streamline access management.

Other key points:
- With EMUs, users log in via their company-managed credentials (through the identity provider).
- Administrators can manage user provisioning, deprovisioning, and access control from the identity provider.
- EMUs are commonly used in larger organizations with strict compliance and security needs.
