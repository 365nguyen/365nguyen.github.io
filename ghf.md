## 1. What are Enterprise Managed Users?

**It's a GitHub Enterprise feature that allows you to manage user access from an external identity provider such as Azure AD or Okta.**

### Explanation:
Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) is a feature in **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** that allows enterprises to control and manage user identities and access via external identity providers, such as **Azure AD** or **Okta**. With this feature, all user accounts in the organization are managed directly by the identity provider, enabling enterprises to enforce security policies, such as single sign-on (SSO), and streamline access management.

Other key points:
- With EMUs, users log in via their company-managed credentials (through the identity provider).
- Administrators can manage user provisioning, deprovisioning, and access control from the identity provider.
- EMUs are commonly used in larger organizations with strict compliance and security needs.

## 2. Is there a free version of GitHub for organizations?

**Yes**

### Explanation:
GitHub offers a free plan for organizations. This plan includes:
- Unlimited public and private repositories.
- Access to core collaboration features like pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions.
- A limited amount of GitHub Actions minutes and storage.

## 3. What is a pull request template?

**Pull request template is a file that defines the default pull request structure that project contributors will automatically see when they open a pull request.**

### Explanation:
A pull request template is a predefined format that helps standardize the information that contributors include when they create pull requests in a repository. It ensures that important details, such as descriptions, related issues, or testing instructions, are not missed. These templates are typically stored in a `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` directory or in the root directory of the repository.

- Saved replies are not limited to repository owners but are available to all users for reusing comments to streamline communication.
